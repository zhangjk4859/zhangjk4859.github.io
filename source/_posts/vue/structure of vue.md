Tips:

- In a traditional app that is not using client-side routing,the browser is essentially going out and fetching the different content that we need from those different urls
- With a Single Page Application,we're really only looking at one page,the **index.html**,and as we click around in it, we're adjusting which view we're seeing of that app, hence we call it a single page application, because all of these pages come from that one **index.html** page.
- <router-view /> is a placeholder replaced by route's component
- In client-side routing,when navigation happens, Vue with the help of Vue router compares and renders the differences without ever having to reload the page
